### Discrete Event-Driven Simulation: An Application of Priority Queues

In this project, I used C++ to design a simulation of a bar. To do this, I used my knowledge of object oriented programing and priority queues to develop a design a discrete event-driven simulation.

More info can be found in the design document <a href="https://github.com/cbates8/SCU-Projects/blob/master/CSCI%2061%20-%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/Software%20Guru's%20Bar%20Project/Discrete%20Event-Driven%20Simulation%20with%20Priority%20Queues.pdf">here</a>.
