# Image Component Labeling

### Depth-First Search using stacks | Breadth-First Search using queues

In this project, I used C++ to write an algorithm that labels components in an image. The program uses stack and queue data structures to implement depth-first and breadth-first search algorithms.

More info can be found in the design document <a href="https://github.com/cbates8/SCU-Projects/blob/master/CSCI%2061%20-%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/Image%20Component%20Labeling/Image%20Component%20Labeling.pdf">here</a>.
