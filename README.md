# Santa Clara University Coursework

In this repository, I have attempted to document all coursework and related projects completed during my undergrad at Santa Clara University. While doing so, I have learned a lot about git, GitHub, and how these tools can be used to benefit personal and group projects.

Under Coursework, each class I took will have its own sub-directory, containing the various projects completed with each course. Each project's directory will contain a description of the project, the code, and sample outputs.
